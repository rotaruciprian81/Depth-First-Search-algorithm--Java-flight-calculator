# Depth-First-Search-algorithm--Java-flight-calculator
Java program to calculate routes and flights distances using Depth First Search Algorithm

The following distances between the nodes have been taken into consideration:

-     Washington-London      3716 miles
-     London â€“ Paris                 235 miles
-     Washington- Houston    1223 miles
-     Washington-Paris            3892 miles
-     Houston-Tokyo                6744 miles
-     Houston-Sydney             8551 miles
-     Houston-London             4901 miles
-     Paris-Frankfurt                 318 miles
-     Paris-Rome                       694 miles
-     Rome-Sydney                  10115 miles
-     Sydney-Paris                     10519 miles

Considering the example presented a program has been developed in Java language and it will calculate the paths and the distances of the flights between the established points.
